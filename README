* Run Scrimmage by selecting some lines and hitting <Leader>s
* A new buffer is opened for you to write a script
* Your script receives your selection through STDIN
* Your selection will be replaced by what you print to STDOUT
* Repeat; the replace happens every time you save the script

Scrimmage's default language is Ruby. You can change this by setting g:scrimmage_default_lang.

First vimscript ever; feedback is heartily welcomed.
